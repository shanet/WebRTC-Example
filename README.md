WebRTC Example
==============

*Modified*

An 'as simple as it gets' WebRTC example.

See [https://shanetully.com/2014/09/a-dead-simple-webrtc-example/](https://shanetully.com/2014/09/a-dead-simple-webrtc-example/) for a detailed walkthrough of the code.

### Usage

The signaling server uses Node.js and `ws` and can be started as such:

```
$ npm install ws
$ node server/server.js
```

With the client running, open `client/index.html` in a recent version of either Firefox or Chrome.

Note that if using Chrome and opening the file locally, you must run Chrome with the `--allow-file-access-from-files` flag. Or you could serve the files with a webserver (Python's SimpleHTTPServer is a good option).
