WebRTC Example
==============

An 'as simple as it gets' WebRTC example.

See [https://shanetully.com/2014/09/a-dead-simple-webrtc-example/](https://shanetully.com/2014/09/a-dead-simple-webrtc-example/) for a detailed walkthrough of the code.

Note: This repo is kept updated. The general ideas are there, but the above blog post may be somewhat out of date with the code in this repo.

## Usage

If you use `asdf` to manage tool versions a `.tool-versions` file is included in this repo.

The signaling server uses Node.js and `ws` and can be started as such:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

With the server running, open Firefox/Chrome/Safari and visit `https://localhost:8443`.

Please note the following:

* Note the HTTPS! There is no redirect from HTTP to HTTPS.
* You\'ll need to accept the invalid TLS certificate as it is self-signed and WebRTC must be run over TLS.
* Some browsers or OSs may not allow the webcam to be used by multiple pages at once. You may need to use two different browsers or machines.

## Problems?

This is a short example that I don't check often. As such, I rely on users for reports if something breaks. Issues and pull requests are greatly appreciated.
