WebRTC Example
==============

#### shane tully (shanetully.com)

An 'as simple as it gets' WebRTC example.

See [https://shanetully.com/2014/09/a-dead-simple-webrtc-example/](https://shanetully.com/2014/09/a-dead-simple-webrtc-example/) for a detailed walkthrough of the code.

Note: This repo is kept updated. The general ideas are there, but the above blog post may be somewhat out of date with the code in this repo.

## Usage

The signaling server uses Node.js and `ws` and can be started as such:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

With the server running, open a recent version of Firefox, Chrome or Safari and visit `https://localhost:8443`.

* Note the HTTPS! There is no redirect from HTTP to HTTPS.
* Some browsers or OSs may not allow the webcam to be used by multiple pages at once. You may need to use two different browsers or machines.

## TLS

Recent versions of Chrome require secure websockets for WebRTC. Thus, this example utilizes HTTPS. Included is a self-signed certificate that must be accepted in the browser for the example to work.

## Problems?

WebRTC is a rapidly evolving beast. Being an example that I don't check often, I rely on users for reports if something breaks. Issues and pull requests are greatly appreciated.
